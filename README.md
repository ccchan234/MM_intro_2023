# MM_intro_2023, help need-ed. 
My plans for mindmanager macros for yr2023

Hi, 
========================
Mindmanger specific:

Good, very functional:
NoteTextPopularization

Good, works fine but can do more:
MM2AK* (/w respect to obsidian_to_anki)

Good, but /w some problem (not yet finished):
2MapComparer
1MapComparer

Abandoned:
SelectAllSubtopics (abandoned, mm2020 have buildin using Advanced-> select dependencies)
chatGPT MM* (/w respect to chatGPD MD for obsidian)
obsolete: TagPopularization (no need in mm)

=============================
general software:

Good, very functional
Tree2HTMLTree



Abandoned:
ClibBoardSublimator
